# Hybrid evolutionary algorithms

1. Hybrid algorithm is useful to enhance performance. Combining EA with DNN ir other stuff or things from DSP.
2. Conecpt of Hybrid algorithm is important in algorithmic thinking.


## Example in optical commnications systems.

1. Apply to design Power equalizer for optical communication systems.
2. non-linear DSP equalizers.
3. We can integrate multiple hybrid algorithm into each individual blocks.
4. EC-based Voltara Non-linear filter.


## Desiging voltara non-linear filter
1. We want to tune the weight of this non-linear filter.
2. However, the number of order and compuatations needed for these coefficients gets higher and higher.
3. Just like the DSP architectureal search.
