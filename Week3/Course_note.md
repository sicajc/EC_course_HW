# Connection with Evolution algo
 1. Stohastic population of individuals
 2. States representation


# Flow Chart for EA and main components
- Representation Individuals
- Evaluation
- Population
- Selection: Parent selection/Survivor
- Variation: Recombine
- Initialization

# Two pillars of evolution
 1. Increase diversity pushing toward novelty
 2. Decrease diversity by pushing toward quality


# Population
 - Holding candidate solutions of the problem as individuals(states)

 - Selection operators act on population level
 - Variation operators acts on individual level
 - Diversity
