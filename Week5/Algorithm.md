# Algorithm 1

1. Important point is that each element must participate 2 times within the binary tournament s.t. the list remains the same length.

2. If the fitnesses are exactly the same, choose one element in random using randomness p = 0.3 or so.

# Why is this not good enough?

1. Because we are not creating any mutations, not giving more informations to the population.
